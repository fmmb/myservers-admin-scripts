Please make sure that your directory has the correct permissions.
You must prevent other users from looking into your backups and logs.

# User management

Grab the list of users from the fenix and convert it to a suitable format

	cat users/2020-2021-ceb-fenix.txt | ./fenix2info.sh > users/2020-2021-ceb
	cat users/2020-2021-tmcd-fenix.txt | ./fenix2info.sh > users/2020-2021-tmcd

Add new users to the corresponding group (e.g. tm, ceb, tmcd, phd, msc), based on a list of users.    

    sudo ./append_users.sh users/2020-2021.tm tm

If you want to send an e-mail for the users, you must set the variable "admin\_email\_pass" first.

	read admin_email_pass
	export admin_email_pass
	sudo -E ./append_users.sh 2020-2021.tm tm

Reseting the password of a student 

    sudo ./reset_password.sh a00001 [fmmb[at]iscte-iul.pt]
   
Adding students to a new group that does no exist yet 

    sudo addgroup phd
    sudo ./append_users.sh users/phd.txt

### Deactivating a user

    chsh --shell /usr/sbin/nologin $user


### Delete user accounts

Warning: the option `--remove-all-files` is nasty since it can remove data from backups. 

    cat /etc/passwd | awk -F':' '/^a[0-9].*nologin/ {print $1}' | while read user; do
      name=$(cat /etc/passwd | grep "^$user:" | awk -F'[:,]' '{print $5}' | tr ' ' '_')
      echo "Deleting $user ($name)"
      echo deluser --remove-home --backup-to /home/archive $user
      echo mv /home/archive/$user.tar.bz2 /home/archive/$user.$name.tar.bz2
    done


# Policies

At the end of a semester
* we deactivate all the user accounts from that semester. 
* A few weeks later we move the home directories to `/home/archive`.
* After some time, we backup those directories to an external drive a completely delete them. 

Each semester we create a new group for the new students, and change the name of the old one (e.g. tm => tm.2021-2022)

# Skeleton

You may want to create the file /etc/skel/.vimrc

	syntax on
	set shiftwidth=4
	set tabstop=4
	set softtabstop=4
	
	"set autoindent
	"set number
	"set expandtab

	set backup
	set writebackup

	set backupdir=~/.vim_backups,.
	set directory=~/.vim_backups,.

please consider adding the following to /etc/skel/.profile

	HISTSIZE=10000
	HISTFILESIZE=50000

# System administration

Analyse the permissions of all student users and makes sure that they are set to the default value

	sudo ./set_permissions.sh

Backup all users
	
	sudo ./backup.sh

You may want to add these scripts to your cron, and send the result to a log file


You will need to check and kill processes of some students that are not being carefull. The following command will do it for you. Without parameters, the script only performs the analysis but does nothing. `fkill` performs a `forced kill`
	
	./killmultproc.sh [kill|fkill]

You may want to add the following line to the root's cron during the 8th week (last week of trab2)

	*/5 * 5-12 11 * /home/admin/scripts/killmultproc.sh kill &> /dev/null

Students will be creating IPCS and will not delete them. You may want to do so, once in the while

	./ipcrm_all.sh
	./ipcrm_all.sh a[0-9]
	./ipcrm_all.sh fmmb

You may also want to add a new line to the root's cron during the week 12.

# Other stuff

You may execute the following command to avoid encoding problems

    export LC_ALL="pt_PT.UTF-8"

Use ASCII only and remove special characters 

    iconv -f UTF-8 -t 'ASCII//TRANSLIT'
   
Analyse running processes 

    ps -eo pcpu,pid,user,args --no-headers| sort -t. -nk1,2 -k4,4 -r |head -n 5


# Giving some previledges to the staff (SO server only)

Also add the users to the group, by adding the users to `/etc/group`. Example:
    
    staff:x:50:cecoutinho,...

Add the following lines to `/etc/sudoers` 

    %sudopass ALL=(ALL) ALL, !NSHELLS
    %sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL, !NSHELLS, !NSU
    %staff ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/ipcs, /bin/kill


# Real Example

    cat users/2021-2022-ceb-fenix.txt | grep -v "Pedido" | ./fenix2info.sh  > users/2021-2022-ceb.txt
    # move old ceb to ceb.202X-202Y
    sudo addgroup ceb
